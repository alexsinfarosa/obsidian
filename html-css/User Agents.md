Software that acts on the user's behalf.

There are different types of User Agents:
- Browsers (deliver information visually)
- Screen Readers (deliver information via spoken words)
- Google Bots (it categorises data and makes it available in a google search engine)

Our job as developers is to write HTML documents (along with CSS and JavaScript...) to allow user agents to work successfully.
