## Metadata

The `head` element contains the metadata. Most metadata is specified using the tag `meta`. However, there are some metadata that are so common that have their own tag such as the `title` metadata.

`<section>` = thematic grouping

in the HTML spec the **Categories** represents what **is**, while **Content model** what content the element can have within it.
