* What does a `doctype` do?
	* It is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is **an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in**.
* How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
	* Set the desired language in the html tag ex: `<html lang='en'>`. This is important for screen readers.
	* Have the content in different languages and use some logic to present it to the user. 
	* Use Google translator or others to translate content. Not recommended.
	* Consider also CSS differences such as font size, direction and other things when the content is written in multiple languages.
* What kind of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
* What are `data-` attributes good for?
	* It allows us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements
* Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
* Describe the difference between a `cookie`, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.
	* These are all client storage solutions. Since the http protocol is stateless, we use these storage mechanisms to store information in the browser.
* Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`

	* Keep your scripts right before `</body>`. Async can be used with scripts located there in a few circumstances (see discussion below). Defer won't make much of a difference for scripts located there because the DOM parsing work has pretty much already been done anyway.

Here's an article that explains the difference between async and defer: [http://peter.sh/experiments/asynchronous-and-deferred-javascript-execution-explained/](http://peter.sh/experiments/asynchronous-and-deferred-javascript-execution-explained/).

Your HTML will display quicker in older browsers if you keep the scripts at the end of the body right before `</body>`. So, to preserve the load speed in older browsers, you don't want to put them anywhere else.

If your second script depends upon the first script (e.g. your second script uses the jQuery loaded in the first script), then you can't make them async without additional code to control execution order, but you can make them defer because defer scripts will still be executed in order, just not until after the document has been parsed. If you have that code and you don't need the scripts to run right away, you can make them async or defer.

You could put the scripts in the `<head>` tag and set them to `defer` and the loading of the scripts will be deferred until the DOM has been parsed and that will get fast page display in new browsers that support defer, but it won't help you at all in older browsers and it isn't really any faster than just putting the scripts right before `</body>` which works in all browsers. So, you can see why it's just best to put them right before `</body>`.

Async is more useful when you really don't care when the script loads and nothing else that is user dependent depends upon that script loading. The most often cited example for using async is an analytics script like Google Analytics that you don't want anything to wait for and it's not urgent to run soon and it stands alone so nothing else depends upon it.

Usually the jQuery library is not a good candidate for async because other scripts depend upon it and you want to install event handlers so your page can start responding to user events and you may need to run some jQuery-based initialization code to establish the initial state of the page. It can be used async, but other scripts will have to be coded to not execute until jQuery is loaded.
* Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
* What is progressive rendering?
* Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
* Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
* What is the difference between `canvas` and `svg`?
* What are empty elements in HTML ?
