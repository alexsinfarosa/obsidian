# Testing

```bash

"script": {

"prettier": "prettier --ignore-path .gitignore",

"format": "npm run prettier -- --write" //

}

```

The double dash `--` informs npm to forward to the script on the left of `--` the properties on the right. In the script above when we type `npm run format` we run the `prettier` script with the added `--write` property.

### Jest

We can create test files in a folder called `__tests__` or we can place those files anywhere by adding `.test` the the name of the file, ex: `sumFunction.test.js`

### Unit Test

Test in isolation, whether it is a function or a react component.

### Integration Test

How components exchange information with each other.

### Test a component

- Render the component
- Find the component in the DOM
- Interact with the component
- Assert that the results are as expected
