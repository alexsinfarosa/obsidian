# Arrow Function

```js
const arrowFn = () => {}
```

- An arrow function does not have its own `this`
- An arrow function does not have its own `arguments` array-like object
- Cannot be used as `methods`
- Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with `new` throws an error.

In modern code `[[rest parameters]]` should be preferred.
